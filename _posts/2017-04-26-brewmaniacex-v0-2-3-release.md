# **Bugs Fixed**

- PWM display for multiple sensors.
- Resumption after boil phase.

# Changes

- If PID is used during Malt-in., the setting temperature is set to the temperature of Mash-in.
- Pump access during Adding Malt. The “No” option during “Add Malt” is moved to “Temperature Reached” screen of Mash-In. (It was only “Yes”.)
- Full version label is displayed.

Everything in [v0.2.2\[preview\]](http://vito.tw/?p=674) is included.
