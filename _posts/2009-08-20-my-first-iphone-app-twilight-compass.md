![Twilight Compass](http://vito.tw/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/main.jpg "Twilight Compass")  ](itms://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=328226661&mt=8&s=143441)  
The twilight is a popular topic of photography. The sun is the main character and plays a very important role in the pictures. To get good pictures, the position of the sun must be known before sunrise or sunset happens so that composition is possible. Aloughth there is sunset and sunrise everyday in most area of the world, we may have only one chance to take a picture at a particular place. Knowing the time and the direction of sunrise/sunset helps.  
Aloughth the real time and direction are affected by the landform, The rough direction and the time of sunrise/sunset can be calculated by the location coordinate. Because the new iPhone 3Gs is equipped with digital compass and GPS, an application calculating the information of sunrise/sunset is possible. Twilight Compass is the solution.  
It took me more time to understand the process of running APP on iPhone and publishing APP than to write the APP itself. Finally, I managed to finish the procedure, and Twilight Compass will be available soon.
