This release is to enable BrewManiacEx to work under AP mode, so that you can use it without an Access Point.  
It also fixes a bug which will result in RESET of system if the connected network disappears.  
A new button to “disconnect current WiFi” is added in “Network Config”. The username and password must be input to enable the button. This button is used to clear the WiFi data, so that you can disconnect from current WiFi. You must, however, restart the system to select new network after that.  
The user manual is also updated. Thanks to Iain, who corrected my typos and grammar errors.
