[Google changed audio auto play policy](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes), and audio won’t be played without user’s interaction. To follow the new policy, which is also requirement of mobile Safari, a new button is added so that user interaction can be done to enable audio playing.  
The new web(HTML/JS) interface is version 4.1, which works with firmware version 4.0.
