I have been develop BrewManiacEx myself, but I am not alone. Although most of the features are design to fit my own requirements, some of them are from discussions with readers of this blog. I appreciate your suggestions. To make it easier for you to provide your invaluable suggestions and to setup a better way of communication, I setup a Facebook page dedicated for BrewManiacEx. That should also provide a better notification of new release in the future, if you ‘like’ it. You can still comment here, though.

There is not a project manager, so the development is erratic and arbitrary. Current release already has almost everything I need except recipes. Therefore, the next feature to added will be recipe. In my opinion, editing recipe on a brew controller doesn’t make much sense because the brew controller is usually only turned on at brewing day. Importing of a recipe is ratively reasonable. The current de-facto standard seems to be BeerXML, and that’s what I am going to support. Given the fact that browsers have XML parser built-in, the difficult part will be the presentation. I haven’t thought of a way to display. Any suggestions are welcome.
