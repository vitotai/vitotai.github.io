The major enhancement is on the format of “remote logging”.

- Add PUT method
- Use printf-like format
- Data Type.(Content-type)

The printf-like format and specification of content type provides maximum flexibility. You can use any format with your own “field name” or “variable name”. So far, form type (thingspeak.com) and JSON format (ubidots.com) have been tested and verified. I hope to test XML format if I can find one.  
You can find the example in readme.md at GitHub.
