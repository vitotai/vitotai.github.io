It took me a while to finish the process of APP publish on APP Store, and now it is available on line!  
[Get it on App Store](itms://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=328226661&mt=8&s=143441)  
The features of v1.1 is planned at beginning, however I learned that it will spend sometime to publish an APP, and I decided to publish it fisrt and then update it later. The features are determined now, and they are:  
1.Location by input also (current location only in v1.0)  
2.Date by input also (today only in v1.0)  
3.”Next” sunrise/sunset, display sunrise/sunset of tomrrow if the time already passes.  
4\. Additional information about twilight, including Astronomical, Nautical, and Civil Twilight  
5.Latitude/Longitude formats setting  
Estimated available date should be within one month.
