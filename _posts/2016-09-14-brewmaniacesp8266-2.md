I finally built a control box to be used with GrainFather. Using a water-proof project box and membrane keypad makes me feel more comfortable to use it in the environment of a lot of water. The ports for lines under the box does void water-proof, but at least I don’t need to worry about water and wort drop.  
Only a small hole is ported for the membrane keypad to ensure maximum water-proof. The clear cover of the project box in fact makes reading a little more difficult. However, it doesn’t bother me too much.  
I should’ve cut a wood sheet and printed something on it to beautify the front cover, which is in fact more difficult to me, compared to writing the program.

Inside, it is a mess. Including the membrane keypad and LCD, the other components are:

- buzzer
- NodeMcu board
- small PCB for “power bus” and temperature sensor pull-up resistor.
- PCF8574 board
- 5V Power supply (The black object. I attach tab on it to avoid contact to the LCD.)
- SSR and Really board.

The brew went well. There is not a glitch during the whole brew. Although there are things to be improved, I like it more than the original Arduino and ESP8266 version.  
Somehow, it reminds me the brain bio chip in Battle Angel.
